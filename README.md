# Ordenacao_Biblioteca

Designed to be a solution for ordering book lists.

## Getting Started

This project was developed exclusively using JAVA 8. \n
To make use of it, clone/download this repository \n
Then configurate the file sis.config inside the config folder accordingly to the desired sorting method. \n
Execute the Main class and the list inside it will be sorted. \n


### Prerequisites

JAVA JDK 8 must be installed beforehand.

### Installing

The first step will be cloning or downloading this repository.

Secondly, start the program and configure the sis.config through the requested input according to this logic:
	
There are three numbers, "0 0 0", each is a column name: 'Ano de Edição' , 'Autor' , 'Título', respectively.
Each can be set with 0, 1 or 2, those being 'No filter', 'Ascending', 'Descending', respectively.

So, if you want to sort by, for example, "Edição descendente, Autor descendente, Título ascendente" the config would be: "2 2 1"
